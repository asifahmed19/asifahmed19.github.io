       Different people have different purposes of life. Some focus on power, some on wealth, some want to become a rich businessman, some choose knowledge & education while some choose fame. <br>
        <br>
       Across the wings of time few of them discovers their purpose. But there are many others who are ambitious in their very childhood and find their professional goals. I am one of those people.<br>
       <br>
       My purpose of life is to become a successful software engineer. Software engineering is highly respected in the field of information technology as almost every field is associated with computers this days.<br>
